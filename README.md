# KOALA42.PM
Technical assessment - KOALA42

Problem:
Client is losing $600 per month from one venue.

Client has multiple ad accounts (20+) linked with multiple venues (eshops) for
which he runs ad campaigns.
After iOS 14 privacy measures, facebook reported conversions are no longer precise,
because Facebook pixel can be opt-outed from facebook iOS app.

Our software solution will provide accurate data tracking and analytics to mitigate the impact of iOS 14 privacy measures.

Roadmap:
Client needs the work to be doen in 6 months
Budget is no problem
Agile - Scrum SDLC
Requirements (what is exactly needed together with static testing) 
Development of backend infrastructure (together with unit testing - developers)
Integration of application programming interface (together with API testing - Postman)
Development of frontend and UX/UI design (component library using Atomic design - automation testing of fronted components)
Testing needs to be covered in every phase

Project team 7-8 people:
1. Scrum master/Project manager (1/1)
2. Backend developers (3 + 2 for API)
3. Frontend developers (4)
4. UX/UI designer (1)
5. Testers (2)

Technical stack:
Jira, Git repo, Daily stand-ups, 2 week sprints, retrospective 
For communication Microsoft Teams/Google Meet/Slack
For backend .NET/C#
For frontend React/Angular 
Testing in Postman together with Playwright or could be Cypress/C# Selenium

Aim to test as early as possible to save many and find defects in the software and even requirements/documentation.
