# KOALA42.PM - Technical Assessment

## Problem Statement:
The client is experiencing a monthly loss of $600 from a single venue. 
This is attributed to the imprecise reporting of conversions on Facebook, particularly after the implementation of iOS 14 privacy measures. 
Due to these measures, Facebook Pixel data can now be opted out from the Facebook iOS app.

Our solution for software aims to provide accurate data tracking and analytics, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of iOS 14 privacy measures.

## Roadmap:
The client has 6-month timeline for this project with an unrestricted budget. 
We will adopt an Agile - Scrum Software Development Life Cycle approach to ensure flexibility and efficiency throughout the development process. 

**Requirements:** 
- Development of backend infrastructure (including unit testing).
- Integration of Application Programming Interface (accompanied by API testing using Postman).
- Development of frontend components and UX/UI design (leveraging Atomic design principles, with automation testing of frontend components).

Testing will be integrated into every phase of development to ensure robustness and reliability.

## Project Team (7-8 members):
1. **Scrum Master/Project Manager:** 1
2. **Backend Developers:** 3 (with an additional 2 for API development)
3. **Frontend Developers:** 4
4. **UX/UI Designer:** 1
5. **Testers:** 2

## Technical Stack:
- **Project Management:** Jira
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Development Process:** Daily Stand-ups, 2-week Sprints, Retrospectives
- **Communication Tools:** Microsoft Teams/Google Meet/Slack
- **Backend:** .NET/C#
- **Frontend:** React/Angular
- **Testing Tools:** Postman, Playwright (or alternatively, Cypress/C# Selenium)

Our goal is to ensure testing at the earliest possible stage to minimize costs and identify any defects in the software, including issues in requirements and documentation.
